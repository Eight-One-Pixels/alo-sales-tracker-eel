- **Amendment**: Any role can amend rejected conversions, restarting the process

### 2. User Role Permissions
- **Reps**: Submit conversions, view their own conversions, amend rejected ones
- **Managers**: Recommend pending conversions, amend rejected ones

## Next Steps
The approval workflow is now fully implemented and ready for production use. The system ensures that:

1. Only approved conversions count toward revenue and commission totals
2. All users can see the approval status of conversions clearly
3. Rejected conversions can be easily amended by any authorized role
